# CodeEditor

<p> A free, interactive, and educational software tool available for anyone with internet and computer access. 
    Code Learner is a Java-based application that was built using IntelliJ, an open source IDE owned by JetBrains. 
    The application stores all information in a database, from a user’s details to questions, modules and their 
    corresponding scores upon completion. WampServer, a web development platform on Windows that allows users to 
    create dynamic applications with Apache2, PHP, and MySQL was used to mimic our SQL database structure locally 
    by using phpMyAdmin. Additionally, password encryption was put in place to protect the user’s information, and 
    an email account was created on its behalf to allow users to reset their passwords securely through the use of 
    a token that is emailed to their accounts. </p> <br>
    
<p> Although Code Learner is currently only offering a course on the basics of C++, by dividing it into modules, the 
    purpose of the application is to educate its users on a wide variety of subjects within the fields of STEM as more 
    courses are to be added in the future. The wide variety of subjects that will be made available on Code Learner will 
    be made for students at any grade level, from elementary school all the way to the collegiate level. The goal of Code 
    Learner is to diversify the field of STEM by solving some of the many problems that hinder underrepresented minority 
    groups from pursuing a degree within the fields of STEM. Future implementations of Code Learner will include introductions 
    to various other programming languages such as Java, Go, and Python. Posting our project on a web page to host it as a web 
    application would also like to be implemented in the future. If given more time, we would also like to incorporate a more 
    robust progression and scoring system for the user. Other implementations will include learning tutorials through videos, 
    interactive coding games, and projects that will help the user understand what they are doing.
